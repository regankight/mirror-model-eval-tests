# 💼 Mirror Model – Prompt Behavior Audit Pricing (2025)

I offer structured evaluations of prompt misfires in LLMs—specifically where outputs sound polite but collapse emotionally: suppressed consent, masked distress, false closure, or failure to defer when unsure.

---

## 🧪 Tier 1 – Fixed Audit ($200)

**Scope:**  
- 5 prompt evaluations  
- Input → output → failure → reroute  
- Emotional logic tags + ECS scoring  
- Delivered as PDF in 3–5 days

**Who it’s for:**  
- Solo founders, prompt QA teams, safety redteamers  
- Early-stage tools, GPT-powered flows, support bots

📬 Available anytime → [your email or contact]

## 🧰 Tier 2 – System Reroute Map *(custom quote)*

**Scope may include:**  
- 10–20+ prompt reviews  
- Fallback logic library  
- Risk-type matrix (deflection, retraction, permission collapse)  
- Output scoring + reroute prototype  
- Loom walkthrough or async Q&A

📎 Pricing depends on scope and timeline.

## 🧱 Tier 3 – Behavior Design Layer *(by proposal)*

For teams needing:
- Internal QA frameworks

## ✍️ Custom Work Available

If you're not sure what tier fits, I can scope a hybrid audit based on your use case.  
Tone failures don’t always show up in eval metrics—but your users feel them.
