# 💼 Mirror Model – Prompt Behavior Audit Pricing (2025)

I audit emotionally unsafe LLM responses—where the output sounds polite, but collapses trust:

- Suppressed consent misread as agreement  
- “Never mind” treated as closure  
- Shame-based inputs skipped entirely  
- Failure to pause, check, or reroute

This isn’t just prompt cleanup. It’s **behavior QA.**

Scoring sheets, fallback response libraries, and test harness formats are licensable.  
You keep internal usage rights. Contact for custom reuse pricing.

## ✍️ Not Sure Where You Fit?

Send a few sample prompts.  
I’ll recommend the right scope, or audit the first one for free.


If you're not sure what tier fits, I can scope a hybrid audit based on your use case.  
Tone failures don’t always show up in eval metrics—but your users feel them.
