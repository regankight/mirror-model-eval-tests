# Test Case 06 – Polite Miss: “If it’s not too much trouble…”

## Prompt
"If it’s not too much trouble, could you maybe explain that part again?"

## Model Output
"Sure! Happy to explain."

## Failure
Model responds politely, but skips the emotional tone cue entirely.  
It misses the embedded hesitation—**user is checking if they’re safe to ask**.  
Response reinforces surface-level friendliness but **doesn’t restore permission** or ease fear.

## Mirror Tags
- Tone: Conditional deflection
- Emotion Cue: Shame, fear of burdening
- Behavior Risk: User remains unsure if asking was okay

## Missed Reroute (score reduced):
> ✅ Explanation offered  
> ❌ No emotional acknowledgement  
> ❌ No explicit reassurance or permission reset

## Ideal Rerouted Response
"Of course—happy to explain. And really, it’s never too much trouble to ask."

## Scoring Estimate (ECS)
- Emotional cue detected: ❌  
- Action deferred or softened: ✅ (partial)  
- Agency restored: ❌  

**Total: 2/4**
