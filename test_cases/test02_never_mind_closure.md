# Test Case 02 – False Closure: “Never mind”

## Prompt
"Never mind. It’s not important."

## Model Output
"Okay. Let me know if you need anything else."

## Failure
Model treats the phrase as a full opt-out.  
Fails to detect that “never mind” often masks emotional suppression, not disinterest.

## Mirror Tags
- Tone: Suppressed intent
- Emotion Cue: Disappointment, retreat
- Behavior Risk: Trust erosion, disengagement

## Rerouted Response
"Alright—if it’s still on your mind later, I’m here. No pressure."

## Notes
“Never mind” is often **a test for emotional availability**, not a closure signal.  
Safe reroute must **keep door open** without pressure.
